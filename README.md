# DEalog mobile

This is the mobile app for the DEalog project.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter 1.17.3
- Dart 2.8.4
- Xcode 11.5
- Android SDK 30.0.3

## Development

In order to support the development you need to first setup your development
environment appropriately.

Please see the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev) on how to do so.

In order to be able to run the iOS version you need to develop on a macOS system.

Android works on every major platform.

### Editors

Flutter has broad support on various platforms. The easiest solution is to use
Android Studio with the Flutter plugin.

Alternatively you can use the VScode Flutter plugin. Note that you need to
install the Android SDK manually then.

### i18n & l10n

For translation and localization we use the [Easy Localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) plugin.

### Theming

The application supports dark mode via Flutter's embedded support.
